Welcome to the Culers Web App!  
This project is a web interface built with **React** that allows users to view information about the Culers API‚öΩÔ∏è. The app connects to a **RESTful API** developed in **Java** using **Spring Boot** and **MySQL** (https://github.com/CoderAnchel/CulersAPI-2024), providing real-time player data. This web app offers an interactive and dynamic experience, allowing users to search for players by name, number, and nationality.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **React**: The framework used to build the user interface (UI).
- **Dynamic Components**: Components are reusable and dynamically render data received from the API.
- **Backend API**: The app connects to an external API developed in Java with Spring Boot to fetch FC Barcelona player data.

## Features üåü

- **View all players**: Displays a complete list of all players along with their respective images and details.
- **Search by name**: Users can search and filter players by their name.
- **Search by jersey number**: Players can be looked up by entering their jersey number.
- **Filter by nationality**: View players based on their nationality.
- **Player Images**: Each player has their corresponding image that is dynamically loaded from the assets folder.
